# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Purpose

This is a research and documentation repository for a French-language white paper ("Livre Blanc") titled **"Enterprise Architects Emerge as Strategic AI Advisors"**. It explores how enterprise architects transition from technical documentation roles to strategic advisors for organizational AI initiatives.

There is no application code, build system, or test suite. The repository contains structured Markdown documents.

## Writing Standards

All content must follow these rules (defined in the TDM file's "Instructions de rédaction"):

- **Language**: French Canadian (OQLF-recommended terms; preserve established English technical terms in EA and AI domains)
- **Volume**: Minimum 5,000 words per chapter (excluding figures/tables/references); executive summary, foreword, and conclusion: 1,500-2,500 words each
- **Tone**: Scientific, professional, neutral, analytical. No marketing language or hyperbole
- **Argumentation**: First-principles reasoning. Every significant claim must cite a verifiable source (analyst reports, academic research, empirical data, documented case studies)
- **References**: IEEE or adapted APA style, numbered, end-of-chapter. Minimum 15-25 references per chapter
- **Data**: Include recent quantitative data (2024-2026) from verifiable sources (Gartner, Forrester, McKinsey, IDC, IEEE, ACM, etc.)
- **Typography**: English technical terms in *italics* at first occurrence with French equivalent in parentheses when applicable. Acronyms defined at first use per chapter and listed in Glossary (Annexe A)
- **Heading levels**: H2 = parts, H3 = chapters, H4 = main subsections, H5 = sub-subsections
- **Chapter structure**: Contextual introduction (200-400 words), numbered subsections, "Points clés à retenir" box, transition to next chapter
- **Figures/tables**: Minimum 2-3 per chapter, described textually as `[Figure X.Y]` or `[Tableau X.Y]` with captions
- **Parts III and IV**: Must include at least one "En pratique" box with a concrete example or architecture pattern per chapter

## Document Structure

The white paper follows a five-part structure with 13 chapters, defined in `TDM_Livre_Blanc_EA_Strategic_AI_Advisors.md` (the master table of contents and research plan). This TDM file is the authoritative source for chapter organization, section numbering, and the consolidated research bibliography.
